# TetrisBot
**March 26, 2024**

In order to start this project, I've first started reading Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. I plan to only go through the following chapters:  
  
Chapter 2: Multi-Armed Bandits  
Chapter 3: Finite Markov Decision Process  
Chapter 5: Monte Carlos Methods  
Chapter 6: Temporal-Difference Learning  
Chapter 8: Planning and Learning with Tabular Methods  
Chapter 9 & 10: On-Policy Prediction and Control with Approximation  
  
Currently, I've worked through chapter 2 and have done research into how I can implement this bot.

Although there are a lot of different gym environments, I wanted to be able to use this bot to participate in multiplayer games. This means that I will use PyAutoGUI in order to screenshot games online and simulate keystrokes. I want to take into account the hold piece and the next pieces as well as the game board so I screenshot that entire region. Other than that, I set up the environment and am moving on to reading chapter 3.
