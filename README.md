# TetrisBot
**March 26, 2024**

In order to start this project, I've first started reading Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. I plan to only go through the following chapters:  
Chapter 2: Multi-Armed Bandits  
Chapter 3: Finite Markov Decision Process  
Chapter 5: Monte Carlos Methods  
Chapter 6: Temporal-Difference Learning  
Chapter 8: Planning and Learning with Tabular Methods  
Chapter 9 & 10: On-Policy Prediction and Control with Approximation  
  
Currently, I've worked through chapter 2 and have done research into how I can implement this bot.
